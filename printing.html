                <h2>3-D Printing</h2>
                <p>3-D Printing has been a hobby of mine ever since I started using the printers at WPI to create robot parts. I started out by learning to help how to maintain the print farm in the Robotics lab at WPI. Soon, I had bought my own Ender 3 to play with and upgrading this printer has allowed it to stay reliable for many years, even to this day. The inspiration for my love of 3-D printing came from being able to tinker with my own printer, constantly adding features or automating tasks. Since getting the printer I have:</p>
                <ul>
					<li>Modified & Built custom firmware for the printer, allowing for expanded functionality and upgrades</li>
					<li>Added unified auto bed leveling using a BLTouch kit to probe the bed</li>
					<li>Upgraded the mainboard for quieter stepper drivers and a 32-bit interface</li>
					<li>Designed and printed custom Z axis stepper motor mounts for better stability</li>
					<li>Upgraded to dual Z axis for better stability</li>
					<li>Upgraded to a direct drive extruder</li>
					<li>Added a Raspberry Pi loaded with OctoPrint for cloud printing and monitoring</li>
				</ul>
                <p>I have also used the printer to create many useful items around the house, such as a custom phone stand, a custom Arduino case, and custom tool storage.</p>

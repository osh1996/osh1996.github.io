                <p><strong>An overview of the product highlighting key navigation technology and features.</strong></p>
            </article>

            <p><strong>I leveraged my expertise as a Senior Mechatronics Engineer at SharkNinja to spearhead the navigation of our 360 LiDAR-based robotic vacuum cleaners. My contributions spanned the entire product lifecycle, from:</strong></p>


            <h3><strong>Sensor Selection</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>I played a key role in selecting the most suitable and reliable LiDAR sensors for our products. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) uses pulsed laser light to measure distance and create highly detailed maps of an environment. In SharkNinja robotic vacuums, 360 LiDAR sensors provide a comprehensive view of the surroundings, enabling:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):</strong> The robot builds a real-time map of its surroundings while simultaneously navigating, ensuring efficient cleaning coverage.</li>
              <li><strong>Object Detection and Avoidance:</strong> The LiDAR sensor helps the robot identify and avoid obstacles like furniture, pet toys, and electrical cords.</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-Floor Mapping and Room Recognition:</strong> With LiDAR, advanced robots can store multiple floor plans and navigate to specific rooms for targeted cleaning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Navigation Engineering</h3>
            <p><strong>I led the engineering team in developing robust navigation algorithms and functionalities that utilize the rich data from the 360 LiDAR sensor. These algorithms enable the robot to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Path Plan:</strong> Intelligently plan efficient cleaning paths that maximize coverage and minimize travel time using a modified A* algorithm designed to run on the embedded platform.</li>
              <li><strong>Real-Time Obstacle Detection:</strong> Dynamically adjust its path to avoid obstacles encountered during cleaning.</li>
              <li><strong>Cliff Avoidance:</strong> Prevent dangerous falls by detecting and properly avoiding any and all drop-offs like stairs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Field Performance and Robustness</h3>
            <p><strong>I spearheaded efforts to ensure exceptional performance and reliability of key navigation sensors and algorithms in real-world environments. This involved:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Actions:</strong> I investigated and resolved high-priority and safety-related consumer issues, including those related to LiDAR sensor performance or navigation malfunctions. I worked with the Chinese LiDAR supplier to implement corrective changes to their LiDAR unit to solve repeat issues with the sensor found in internal testing or the field.  </li>
              <li><strong>Global Manufacturing Oversight:</strong> I traveled internationally to architect and oversee the manufacturing line and testing processes for LiDAR integration and functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Expertise and Leadership</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Embedded Linux Proficiency:</strong> I possess extensive experience working with the embedded Linux operating system, a core component of robotic navigation systems and LiDAR data processing.</li>
              <li><strong>Project Management and Mentorship:</strong> I effectively managed and mentored project engineers, fostering their skill development and growth within the team.</li>
              <li><strong>Accelerated Life Testing:</strong> I conducted accelerated life testing on navigation sensors, including LiDAR, to identify potential weaknesses and optimize supplier selection.</li>
              <li><strong>International Collaboration:</strong> I actively collaborated with international suppliers to enhance LiDAR sensor reliability and address operational challenges during integration into our robotic vacuums.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Impact and Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>My leadership and technical expertise have significantly contributed to the development and success of SharkNinja's innovative robotic vacuum cleaners with 360 LiDAR technology.</li>
              <li>My dedication to quality and reliability helped ensure exceptional performance, efficient navigation, and user satisfaction.</li>
